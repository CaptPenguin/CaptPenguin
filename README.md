- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptPenguin I recently just graduated LSU with a computer science degree in software engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a engineering/programming internship in order to better understand basically everything about computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, javascript, eventually C++, and computer science overall at Louisiana State University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development programs with other students like me who are just interested in learning programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is legendsofzelden@yahoo.com
